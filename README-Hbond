Create an index file named index.dat which lists the atom boundaries for each protein (atom and not residue)

Make all python files executable
chmod +x *.py

The input .gro and .xtc file should only comprise the molecules of interest, so in my case it was Ras and PI3Kalpha

Then run
./master.py npt_protein_only.gro onlyprot_10000frames.xtc

Choose "occ" option when the interactive window opens up via VMD if you want to calculate H-bond occupancy or "num" if you want visualize the all H-bonds w.r.t a specific residue

If this doesn't work you can run  ./direct_vis.py  and repeat the previous step

If you want sort the labels on the Y-axis residue wise run sort_order.py

Save figure.
